# Profiler
A chunk generation profiler

![Build Mod](https://github.com/TerraForged/Profiler/workflows/Build%20Mod/badge.svg)

#### About
This mod injects a series profiling timers into various levels of world-gen code in  
order to build up a (rough) idea of how long each part of chunk generation takes to  
execute.

This may or may not prove to be a useful tool for profiling world-gen and tracing  
poorly performing modded additions to generation.

Notes:
- Timing data is spewed periodically into the logs.
- Each data point is an average time per evaluation.
- You probably shouldn't run this mod all the time - it gets a bit spammy.
